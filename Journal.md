Today, I tried to get the navbar working. I mainly used the [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/) to help me figure that out. I decided to use JavaScript to add the navbar to the site as it felt easiest to me that way. I used code similar to HW3 to add the navbar to the site. In order to fix an accesibility error (alt text for hamburger button in navbar), I used Claude 3.7 to help me fix it. I also added an image carousel using Bootstrap and JavaScript. I have a few accessibility errors but I will address those later.
