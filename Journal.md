Today, I tried to get the navbar working. I mainly used the [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/) to help me figure that out. I decided to use JavaScript to add the navbar to the site as it felt easiest to me that way. I used code similar to HW3 to add the navbar to the site. In order to fix an accesibility error (alt text for hamburger button in navbar), I used Claude 3.7 to help me fix it. I also added an image carousel using Bootstrap and JavaScript. I have a few accessibility errors but I will address those later.

Today I fixed the accesibility errors and I also fixed the carousel to look better. I also added a GitHub button. Thanks to StackOverflow, I was able to embed a PDF of my resume into my HTML. As well, I used EmailJS to handle the form, so that I actually receive emails that visitors want to leave me. I had some bugs regarding email handling, but Claude 3.7 helped me troubleshoot those minor bugs. It turns out the documentation for EmailJS wasnâ€™t updated, but Claude had the updated implementation details.
