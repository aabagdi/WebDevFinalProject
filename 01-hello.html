          <strong>Hi, my name is Aadit!</strong> <br />
          I'm a CS grad student, and I have two terms left. My main passion when
          it comes to CS is iOS development, but outside of CS I love films and
          music! I am excited to learn about the web during this class!

          The Engineering Building is a concrete and glass, five-story building
          located on SW 4th Avenue just south of the Fourth Avenue Building and
          City of Portland Development Tower. The basement of the Engineering
          Building pre-dates its construction and is actually part of the Fourth
          Avenue Building. Designed by the architectural firm, Zimmer Gunsul
          Frasca, the Engineering Building was completed in early 2006.
