          <strong>Hi, my name is Aadit!</strong> <br />
          I'm a CS grad student at PSU, and I am an iOS developer with 5 apps on
          the App Store. I completed my Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science at
          Reed College, and am currently earning a Master of Science in Computer
          Science at Portland State University. Other than Swift, I have
          experience with C, C++, Haskell, Python and Rust. Other than coding,
          my hobbies include music, film and reading. It's nice to meet you!
